=head1 DESCRIPTION

This dependency solver is somewhat different to the existing
L<Algorithm::Dependency> module.

L<Algorithm::Dependency> creates a heirarchy where each node depends
on a set of other nodes. In L<Algorithm::DependencySolver>, there
exists a set of operations and a set of resources, with a set of edges
from operations to resources (the dependencies), and a set of edges
from resources to operations (the affects). Given this input, the
module outputs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) containing just the
operations as its nodes.

Aditionally, L<Algorithm::DependencySolver> allows for input which
whould have resulted in a cyclic output graph to be resolved by means
of explicit sequencing. This is done by marking nodes as depending on
other nodes. See
L<Algorithm::DependencySolver::Operation::prerequisites>.

=head2 get_Graph

Returns the dependency graph as a L<Graph> object. Note that only
operations are included in the graph, not resources. This is of most
use to the L<Algorithm::DependencySolver::Traversal> module, and the
C<to_dot> and C<to_png> methods.

=head2 _remove_redundancy

  $self->_remove_redundancy($G);  # Ignore the return value

Applied to a graph object, removes redundant edges. An edge is
redundant if it can be removed without invalidating the graph.

The fundamental law of the dependency graph is that a node can only be
traversed when all of its predecessors have been traversed. 

Given some node, C<$n>, and a predecessor of C<$n>, C<$a>, then it is
safe to remove C<$a> if and only if another node exists, C<$b>, which
is a predecessor of C<$n>, and there is a path from C<$a> to C<$b>
(i.e., traversal of C<$b> requires that C<$a> has been visited).

Note that cycles may cause this algorithm to behave unexpectedly
(depending on what one expects). Consider what happens if C<$n> has
two successors, C<$a> and C<$b>, such that there is a cycle between
C<$a> and C<$b> (i.e., there is an edge from C<$a> to C<$b>, and
vice-versa). Suppose that the edge from C<$n> to C<$a> has been
removed. Can the edge from C<$n> to C<$b> safely be removed?

Using the algorithm described above, yes! This is because there is
another path from C<$n> to C<$b>: C<$n -&gt; $b -&gt; $a -&gt; b>. We
can, of course, detect such occurrences; however, I choose not to,
because it's not clear to me what the most elegant result should be in
these situations. Semantically, it does not matter whether the edge
from C<$n> to the C<$a,$b>-cycle is from C<$n> to C<$a>, or C<$n> to
C<$b>. Which should it be? Both, or one-or-the-other (presumably
decided arbitrarily)?

Properties:

* This method can be safely called on cyclic graphs (i.e., it will not
  enter a non-terminating loop)

* This method will not fail early if a cycle is encountered (i.e., it
  will do as much work as it can, even though the graph is probably
  invalid)

* If C<_apply_orderings> is to be called on the graph object, it
  I<must> be done I<before> calling C<_remove_redundancy>
